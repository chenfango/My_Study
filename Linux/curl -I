-I/--head
              (HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document.
              When used on a FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification time only.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header only.



curl http://x.x.x.x/ -I
